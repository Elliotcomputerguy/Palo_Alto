# Management profiles

By default Palo alto will not allow icmp. In order to allow ping etc you need to create a management profile and assign it to the interface.

Under the network tab select interfaces and choose your interface and select advanced. Select management profile and apply to the interface. 

You can create multiple interface management profiles to allow different types of traffic. From network tab select interface mgmt 
from network profiles and create a new profile with your desired traffic types.
