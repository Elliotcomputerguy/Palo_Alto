#User ID

User-ID provides a security feature in which it maps users to an ip address allowing the firewall to create policies to allow
or restrict users from accessing categories or destination addresses or services. It also allows for further auditing. 

Setup USER-ID

From network tab, select zones and select the zone you wish to enable USER-ID on. Select inside and select enable user identification. 
Add subnets to be used in user-id and subnets to restrict from user-id policies. 

From Device tab go to user id on left and under usermapping select the cog for agent setup. 

in server monitor account add your account to access the active directory domain.

Under Server monitoring tab add server address and its connection type WMI AD. 

Commit and should show a connected status. 

! If not over the mgmt interface you have to redirect services over that interface. ! From Device tab, select setup, and go to tab 
services and customise.

Under Device tab we need to add a ldap profile. Select LDAP from the left under server profiles
select add, add a profile name, ip address of your ldap server. If you are not concerned about tls untick require tls cert, on
server settings, for type add active directory, Base DN, Should self populate, Bind DN = Your user or service account to access AD

Next step we need to go to Group mapping settings from user identification under Device tab. So under Group Mapping settings 
add new and add name to group mapping profile, add ldap profile to server profile. 


To check user mappings from cli 

show user ip-user-mapping all
