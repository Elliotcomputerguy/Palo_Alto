# Destination NAT

Source nat allows translation of addresses from source to destination. Example: translate internal address to outbound interface of fw would
be source nat. 
Destination nat is translating a global routable address into a private address. Static nat. 

Topology:

                    DMZ Interface eth0/1 172.16.1.11        OUTSIDE Interface eth0/0 23.1.2.11
  [DMZ SERVER] --------------------------------------[fw1]----------------------------------------[internet client] 
172.16.1.100/32                                                                                   23.1.2.23/32  

Allow client 23.1.2.23/32 to reach 172.16.1.100 from the internet via public ip 23.1.2.100

To create a destination nat we go to policies and select NAT. Selecting add we name the policy and 
select original packet. So from the internet we want to allow anyone to reach the dmz server. Our security source zone will be
outside and our destination will also be outside. Source address will be any
one from the internet and our destination address will be the public ip. 
Translated packet tab will be destination address translation. translation type will be static ip, private address you are translating. 
Done. Commit. We then need to permit traffic from outside to dmz. We need to allow source outside to destination dmz via pre nat destination public address.
