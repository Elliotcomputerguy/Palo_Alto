By default security policies intrazone and interzone are enabled. Intrazone permits traffic from same zone. Interzone blocks any traffic from differnet zones.
As Palo Alto being a NGFW it is stateful, meaning that the session that is initiated from a source address is allowed back in as it has 
cahced the session from the source. On a non ngfw you would have to allow the reply traffic. 

Remember that all policies are read from the top down. 

To create a policy you would go to network tab and select security. Add and then add your source zones, addresses, services. 
Universal is used by default and applies to both intra and inter.
