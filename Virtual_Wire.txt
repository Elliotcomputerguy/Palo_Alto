#Virtual Wire

A virtual wire is a connection between two devices going through the firewall. Basically the fw is a man in the middle. Good thing
about a virtual wire is that you can create zones and create policies to permit or block traffic. 

Viable solutions:

2 switches going between the firewall

1 switch and use 1 port from vlan 10 and another port from vlan 20 and associate these interfaces into the firewall. You can then create a 
virtual wire.
