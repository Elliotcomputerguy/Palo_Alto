# App-ID

What is App-ID. App ID is a next generation feature that inspects the traffic and makes sure it that the traffic is matching the default port
for that traffic. It prevents a malicious actor from tunneling traffic behind other tcp ports. Example. Tunneling http traffic through 
ssh port. 

Standard policies would be port based. Next generation others you application based policies. 

To implement application based policy: 
Go to policies, Security and add new. Add source, destination, under application tab select your application. Example: ssh
Under service your see that it says application-default meaning that it is expecting the traffic on its well known port
ok and commit

To implement port based policy:
Go to policies, Security and add new. Add source, destination, under service/url category, create new service object for tcp port 22.
ok and commit
