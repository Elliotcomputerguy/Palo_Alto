# Configure PAT 

To configure PAT go to the policies tab and select NAT. Hit the add button and add name etc. Under original packet tab
Add your source security zone and Destination zone. Add your source address you want to allow to be patted. Under translated packet 
tab we need to choose a translation type which will be dynamic ip and port for PAT, Interface address, Your interface and ip address of interface. 
We will then need to add a policy to allow the traffic from inside zone to outside zone. Which is called interzone. intrazone is from the same zone. 
So with policies tab selected, select security and select add. 

Add name of rule. Rule type will be universal by default. Add source zone and source address, destination zone, destination address, service and permit action.
