# Decryption policies

In order for the firewall to carry out application layer inspection the fireawall needs to be able to 
intercept that traffic. By design when a client establishes a connection with a web server on the public internet it will
create a encrypted tunnel with a tls session key created from the public and private key that is signed by a trusted CA. 

Decryption policies allow the firewall to be the man in the middle terminating connections for the client rather than terminating
on the client. This way the firewall can inspect the traffic. 

There are three types of Destination policies:

SSL PROXY 

Clients from the inside going to a wesite to the outside. 

SSL inbound

Internet users attempting to access a web server in the dmz. 

SSH Proxy

Clients from the inside going to a wesite to the outside.
